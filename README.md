Solar System Simulation in JavaFX

The purpose of this program is to create a simulation of the solar system, where celestial bodies move according to the principles of orbital motion. The program allows for visualization and interaction with the simulation, enabling the user to zoom in, zoom out, and rotate the view.

The simulation depicts the main celestial bodies in the solar system, such as the Sun, planets, and other celestial objects. Each celestial body has its own parameters, such as name, mass, radius, orbital velocity, and texture. The simulation takes into account orbital motion as well as the rotation of celestial bodies around their own axis.

The program allows user interaction through panning, zooming, and rotating the view, allowing for precise observation of the motion of celestial bodies in the simulation.
